------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conditions: 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. plug in all ports, all links must be up.
2. total ports must be even number
3. link speed must be the same as max advertised (10G ports must be on 10G switch )
5. each link speed type ( 10G, 25G, etc..) must have even number of ports. if you have 1 single 100G card, you need to insert another 100G, so the ports can talk to each other properly.

if any of these conditions are not met, the test will exit
